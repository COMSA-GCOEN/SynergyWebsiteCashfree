    question: "What is the difference between a function and a method?",
    answer:
      "A function is a block of code that is called by name. It can be passed data to operate on (i.e. the parameters) and can optionally return data (the return value). All data that is passed to a function is explicitly passed. A method is a block of code that is called by a name that is associated with an object. In most respects it is identical to a function except for two key differences: A method is implicitly passed the object on which it was called. A method is able to operate on data that is contained within the class (remembering that an object is an instance of a class - the class is the definition, the object is an instance of that data).",

    question: "What is the difference between a class and an object?",
    answer:
      "A class is a template for objects, and an object is an instance of a class. So, a class can be defined once, and you can make any number of instances of that class. An object is a specific instance of a class. For example, if you have a class called Car, you can make an object called myFastCar which is a Car, and you can make another object called mySlowCar which is also a Car. Both objects inherit the variables and functions from the Car class.",

    question: "What is the difference between a class and a module?",
    answer:
      "A module is a file, which may contain one or more classes. A class is a template for objects, and an object is an instance of a class. So, a class can be defined once, and you can make any number of instances of that class. An object is a specific instance of a class. For example, if you have a class called Car, you can make an object called myFastCar which is a Car, and you can make another object called mySlowCar which is also a Car. Both objects inherit the variables and functions from the Car class.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why is it important to use the keyword 'this'?",
    answer:
      "The 'this' keyword is used to refer to the current object. It is used to access variables and methods of the current object. It is also used to call the constructor of the current object. It is used to pass a reference of the current object as a parameter to the method of the current object.",

    question: "What is the difference between a class and an interface?",
